# Polkadot Live

Polkadot Live is a Polkadot OpenGov funded project that has been in development since November 2023. It is a cross-platform desktop application that provides subscriptions and performs chain interactions on Polkadot and Substrate based blockchain networks.

Polkadot Live was originally conceptualized by [Ross Bulat](https://github.com/rossbulat) who presented the idea at Polkadot Decoded 2023. The project is currently being actively developed by [Dane Bulat](https://gitbub.com/danebulat), who is working with Ross to realize the project's long-term goals and objectives.

## Summary

- Decentralized Polkadot notifications and chain interactions on the Desktop.
- Receive both native OS notifications and rendered event items within a dedicated UI.
- Seamlessly import any Polkadot, Kusama or Westend address, with additional network support on the roadmap.
- Import addresses via Polkadot Vault, Ledger, or simply pasting an address for read-only mode. 
- Subscribe to balance transfers, and changes to both your nomination pool and direct nominating setup.
- Perform one-shot requests to fetch live data instantly for any given subscription.
- Submit extrinsics without leaving Polkadot Live for tasks such as compounding or withdrawing nomination pool rewards.
- Instantly navigate to an event item's associated Dapp in the browser by clicking action buttons, such as the Staking Dashboard to see more information about your staking setup.
