# Accounts

Polkadot Live currently supports three methods for importing accounts, including:

- Polkadot Vault application
- Ledger Hardware wallet
- Pasting an address (imported as read-only)

Note that the last method will import the address in read-only mode. This is because the application allows you to import any address that exists on its supported Substrate based networks - currently Polkadot, Kusama, and Westend.

After importing a read-only address, you can turn on subscriptions and receive live notifications just like accounts imported via the other methods. However, read-only addresses will not allow you to sign extrinsics, or perform any action that requires knowledge of that address' private key.
