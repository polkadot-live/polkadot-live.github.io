# Extrinsics

Polkadot Live's architecture supports submitting extrinsics to its supported Substrate based networks - currently Polkadot, Kusama and Westend relay chains. This functionality is currently implemented for addresses imported via the __Polkadot Vault__ application.

:::note

Signing extrinsics with Ledger hardware wallets is currently on the roadmap and will be supported in Polkadot Live soon.

:::

An event item will determine which extrinsic(s) you can sign and submit to the network. For example, when an event informs you that an address has pending nomination pool rewards, two action buttons are presented that will allow you to submit an extrinsic for either compounding your rewards back into the pool, or withdrawing them to your account.

It is worth stressing that the process of submitting extrinsics is done entirely within the Polkadot Live application, which is designed to be a non-intrusive, fast, and elegant solution for managing your blockchain activity without putting you off your current work. With this in mind, you are not required to open a browser and navigate to a particular Dapp in order to accomplish a simple task, such as compounding nomination pool rewards.
