# Subscriptions

:::info

Consult the [Subscriptions](/category/subscriptions) section to learn about all the available subscriptions in Polkadot Live.

:::

Two subscription systems currently exist within Polkadot Live, namely __“automatic”__ and __“interval”__ subscriptions. It is also possible to click on __“one-shot”__ buttons to preview a live subscription. It is envisioned that the amount of available subscriptions will increase at a steady-rate as development continues.

Automatic subscriptions will deliver notifications as soon as the tracked metric changes on the respective blockchain network. For example, when balance subscriptions are enabled for an account, a notification will be delivered as soon as the respective account’s balance changes, I.e. when it has sent or received any amount of crypto currency.

Interval subscriptions are available for tracking OpenGov referenda and delivering corresponding notifications in set time periods. In other words, the user is able to set a time interval to control how often they wish to receive notifications for the subscription in question. A good example of an interval subscription is receiving the latest percentages of Aye and Nay votes for a given referendum every 60 minutes.

Subscriptions are available for imported accounts (blockchain addresses), OpenGov referenda, and generic chain events, making it possible to track:
 
- An account’s free, frozen, reserved and spendable balances. 
- Nomination pool staking and direct nominating activity.
- OpenGov referenda metrics.
