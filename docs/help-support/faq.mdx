### Will Polkadot Live support other platforms in the future?
Yes, we will work to support Linux users in the upcoming development phase. Polkadot Live is a cross-platform desktop application, so there are no imminent plans to start working on a mobile version.

### When are beta and stable releases coming out?
The Polkadot Live codebase is currently labeled as an alpha release. We will shortly be submitting a new OpenGov proposal detailing the next development phase that we have planned to bring Polkadot Live to a stable release.

### Is Polkadot Live a wallet?
No, Polkadot Live is a cross-platform Dapp (decentralised application) that establishes a connection with wallets in order to import addresses and public keys. It is currently possible to import addresses via the Polkadot Vault application and Ledger Hardware wallet. Read-only accounts can also be imported by pasting in any valid Polkadot, Kusama or Westend encoded address.

No, Polkadot Live only imports public keys and encoded public addresses for Substrate based networks. It has no knowledge of private keys.

### Can I import and turn on subscriptions for any valid address?

### What Substrate networks does Polkadot Live support?
Polkadot Live currently supports the Polkadot, Kusama, and Westend relay chain networks. We plan on integrating system parachain support in the next development phase.

### How is the Polkadot Live project funded?
We are a fully funded OpenGov project with our first proposal passing in November 2023. We will shortly be submitting our second OpenGov proposal that details the next development phase for the project.
