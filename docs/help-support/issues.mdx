# Reporting an Issue

Polkadot Live is still in its early stages of development and we welcome feedback to drive its progress further.

Feel free to submit an issue in the [Polkadot Live App](https://github.com/polkadot-live/polkadot-live-app) repository on GitHub and we will try to respond promptly.

Reasons to submit an issue may include but are not limited to:

- Reporting a suspected bug or feature that doesn't perform as expected.
- Discussing general UX improvements.
- Suggesting new features.
- Technical discussion about application architecture improvements.
