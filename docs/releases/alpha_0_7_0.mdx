### Fully Responsive Views

All views opened within the base window are now **fully responsive**, ensuring the user interface dynamically adapts to changes in window size.

Additionally, a **three-button toggle group** has been introduced on the far left of the tabs row. Each button corresponds to a predefined window sizeâ€”small, medium, or large. Clicking a button instantly resizes the window to the selected preset.

### OpenGov Enhancements

#### List Active Referenda by Track

OpenGov listings are now organized into two tabs: **Active Referenda** and **History**. As the names suggest, the **Active Referenda** tab displays ongoing referenda that are either being voted on or under preparation, while the **History** tab contains all currently ongoing and past referenda.

To refine the list, you can filter referenda by selecting a specific track using the new UI shown in the screenshot below. Tracks without active referenda will be disabled. For convenience, each track also displays their total number of active referenda:

#### History Tab

The **History** tab offers a complete list of both ongoing and past referenda. This enhanced UI allows users to quickly locate a specific referendum by its **ID** or filter referenda based on their **status**.

Each referendum row includes a **dropdown menu** with direct links to OpenGov portals, where detailed information about the referendum can be accessed.

<Img url="/img/releases/0-7-0-alpha/opengov-01.jpg" maxHeight="350px" />

#### Find and Filter Referenda

New controls have been added, enabling you to quickly jump to a specific referendum by searching for its ID. Additionally, you can filter the referenda listing based on status for more precise results. These controls are available under both the **Active Referenda** and **History** tabs.

<Img url="/img/releases/0-7-0-alpha/opengov-02.jpg" maxHeight="120px" />

To locate a referendum, enter the **referendum ID** and either click the **Search** button or press **Enter** to initiate the search.

The search operates within the current listing and respects any applied filters. For example, if a referendum is in the deciding phase but the **Deciding** filter is disabled, it will not appear in the search results.

#### Referenda Pagination

Page buttons have been added to enhance the user experience and ensure referenda metadata is fetched only when needed. Simply click a page number or an arrow to navigate between pages.

<Img url="/img/releases/0-7-0-alpha/opengov-03.jpg" maxHeight="116px" />

#### Other Enhancements

- Referenda rows now display a status badge and feature a dropdown menu with links to OpenGov portals.
- UI dynamically updates when switching between online and offline modes.

### Extrinsics Enhancements

#### Summary Dialog

Clicking an extrinsic item's **Summary** button opens a dialog with detailed transaction information. This button is located next to the item's **Sign** button and within its **dropdown menu**.

The dialog provides key details such as the sending account, extrinsic type, and estimated transaction fee. The displayed information adapts dynamically based on the transaction type.

#### Extrinsics Pagination

Page buttons have been added to improve user experience, displaying ten extrinsics per page. This pagination system operates the same way as OpenGov referenda pages.

#### Filter Extrinsics

Filter the extrinsics list by toggling status options in the filter dropdown, allowing for easier transaction management.
