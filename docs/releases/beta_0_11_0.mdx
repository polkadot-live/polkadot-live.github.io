### API Handling Enhancements

This release improves how the application handles API connection failures, ensuring better stability and responsiveness. This includes smarter timeout handling, early termination of failed requests, and clearer UI feedback. Users can continue working smoothly and easily retry connections when needed.

- Failed API connection attempts timeout gracefully, allowing the application to remain responsive and process other tasks.
- An `AbortController` mechanism is used to terminate failed connection attempts early within asynchronous functions.
- Main window UIs reflect the connection state for individual networks and update appropriately when a connection attempt fails.
- After a successful connection, account state is automatically synced with the network and relevant subscriptions are initialized.
- Users can manually retry a failed network connection using its **Connect** button in the footer.

### Paseo Asset Hub Migration

The Paseo testnet has completed its Asset Hub migration, moving balances, staking, and governance functionality from the Paseo Relay Chain to the Paseo Asset Hub system chain.

This release updates the application to subscribe to the Paseo Asset Hub instead of the Paseo Relay Chain, ensuring staking and balance subscriptions continue to function correctly.
