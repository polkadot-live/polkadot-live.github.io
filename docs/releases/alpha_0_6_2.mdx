- Design iterations on UI components

### Extrinsics Architecture Enhancements

This release enables users to create, manage and sign multiple extrinsics through the **Extrinsics** window.

#### Extrinsics Window Summary

- A unified interface for managing extrinsics exposed by the application.
- Sign and submit extrinsics to their appropriate blockchain network.
- Extrinsics are verified before signing takes place to make sure they are still valid and can be submitted.
- Extrinsics are added when the user interacts with the application, such as preparing a token transfer on the **Send** screen, or interacting with action buttons on event items.
- The correct signing interface is displayed based on the signing account's import origin.
- Sign extrinsics via the Polkadot Vault application or WalletConnect protocol.
- List all extrinsics or filter the list based on the signing account.

#### Extrinsics Window UI

<Img url="/img/releases/0-6-2-alpha/extrinsics-01.jpg" maxHeight="375px" />

##### 1. Account Filter

All added extrinsic items are displayed by default. It is possible to filter extrinsic items and list only the ones that are associated with a signing account through this select box.

##### 2. Manage Extrinsics

Extrinsic items are listed as clickable accordion panels which expand with more information regarding the extrinsic when clicked. Each panel presents a title, submission status, signing account, category and creation timestamp. Hovering over each icon will present this information in a tooltip.

##### 3. Dropdown Menu

Click the far right three-dotted icon to display a dropdown menu with **Sign** and **Delete** options for the extrinsic item in question.

<Img url="/img/releases/0-6-2-alpha/extrinsics-02.jpg" maxHeight="375px" />

More information about the extrinsic in question is displayed when its panel is clicked. For example, a transfer extrinsic will display both the sender & recipient account names and addresses, the estimated fee for submitting the extrinsic, and other important information related to the transaction. A **Sign** button will allow the extrinsic to be signed and submitted to its corresponding blockchain network.

### Transfer Native Tokens

:::note

This alpha release supports native transfers of up to **100** tokens on **Kusama** and **Westend** networks.

:::

:::note

Sender and recipient accounts listed on the **Send** screen are derived from accounts that have been added in the **Accounts** window. Pasting an arbitrary recipient address is on the roadmap and will be implemented in an upcoming version.

:::

A **Send** screen has been added to the main window that enables native token transfers on Kusama and Westend networks.

#### Send Screen Summary

- Prepare a transfer extrinsic to send native tokens (KSM or WND) to a recipient account.
- Select a **sender account**, **recipient account** and **send amount** before clicking the **Proceed** button.
- After clicking **Proceed**, a new transfer extrinsic item is added to the **Extrinsics** window ready for signing.
- A **Summary** panel allows the user to double-check the transfer before proceeding.

#### Send Screen UI

The screenshots below demonstrate preparing a transfer extrinsic on the Westend network:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '1rem'}}>
  <Img url="/img/releases/0-6-2-alpha/send-01.jpg" maxHeight="375px" />
  <Img url="/img/releases/0-6-2-alpha/send-02.jpg" maxHeight="375px" />

  <Img url="/img/releases/0-6-2-alpha/send-04.jpg" maxHeight="375px" />
</div>

#### Send Screen Behaviour

- Clickable "next step" arrows will become active when the current step is complete.
- When clicked, the next section is expanded while others are collapsed.
- Manually expand any section to display the full UI.
- A progress bar will dynamically update at the top of the screen as sections are completed.
- Easily inspect and copy sender & receiver account addresses to the clipboard.
- When a **sender account** is selected, Polkadot Live will:
    - Fetch its spendable balance.
    - Populate the recipient account list based on the sender network.
- The UI will not allow proceeding with a transfer extrinsic if the send amount is either:
    - Above the signing account's spendable balance
    - Over 100 tokens.

### WalletConnect Extrinsic Signing

This release implements a UI that allows extrinsic signing via the WalletConnect protocol. This UI is displayed in the **Extrinsics** window when an extrinsic item's **Sign** button is clicked, providing the signing account was imported via WalletConnect.

#### WalletConnect Signing UI

<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '1rem'}}>
  <Img url="/img/releases/0-6-2-alpha/wallet-connect-01.jpg" maxHeight="375px" />
  <Img url="/img/releases/0-6-2-alpha/wallet-connect-02.jpg" maxHeight="375px" />
  <Img url="/img/releases/0-6-2-alpha/wallet-connect-03.jpg" maxHeight="375px" />
</div>

#### WalletConnect Signing Steps

1. Click an extrinsic item's **Sign** button.<br /><br />
2. Polkadot Live will determine whether a valid WalletConnect session exists.
    - A session must have approved the signing account.<br /><br />
3. **Screenshot 1** - If a WalletConnect session doesn't exist:
    - Click the **Connect** button to display a WalletConnect QR code.
    - Scan the QR code and approve the signing account within your wallet to establish a session.<br /><br />
4. **Screenshot 2** - Polkadot Live will verify the session that was just approved.
    - The session must have approved the signing account.
    - If not, an error message is displayed and connecting to a new session is required.<br /><br />
5. **Screenshot 3** - Click the **Sign** button and do the following in your wallet:
    - Review the extrinsic and its associated data.
    - Ensure that the extrinsic data (send amount, claim amount, etc.) and recipient address is correct.
    - Tap the approval button to submit the extrinsic.<br /><br />
6. The **Extrinsics** window UI will automatically update as the transaction is submitted and finalized on the blockchain.
