# macOS

This page details how to install Polkadot Live on macOS either by downloading the pre-built DMG installer, or building the application directly from source.

## Installer

:::info

We have deployed a Polkadot Live [landing page](https://polkadot-live.app/) that provides download links for **macOS arm64** and **Windows x64** installers.

:::

Navigate to the Polkadot Live's [latest release](https://github.com/polkadot-live/polkadot-live-app/releases/latest) on GitHub and locate the DMG installer download link at the bottom of the page:

Click the DMG installer link and download it to your system. After downloading is completed, double-click the DMG file to open it in Finder:

<Img url="/img/getting-started/mac-dmg-installer.png" maxHeight="250px" />

Drag the `Polkadot Live` application over the `Applications` directory to to install it to the standard installation location on your system.

You can now delete the downloaded DMG file and eject the installer. From there, double-click the `Polkadot Live` application in your `Applications` directory to open Polkadot Live.

Double click on the `Polkadot Live` application to launch it. A new icon will be displayed in the system's **top menu bar**. Click it to show and hide the main window:

You can close the application altogether by selecting **Exit** from the main window's [cog menu](/user-interface/main/overview#cog-menu).

## Build From Source

Follow the instructions below to build Polkadot Live from source on macOS.

### Install dependencies

1. Install the Homebrew package manager if you haven't already. Copy and paste the installation command on its homepage at [https://brew.sh](https://brew.sh).


2. Open a terminal and run the following commands to install necessary dependencies, starting with Git and GitHub CLI:
    ```
    brew install git
    brew install gh
    ```

3. Install Node.js and verify a successful install by checking its version output:
    ```
    brew install nodejs
    node --version
    npm --version
    ```

    If you already have Node.js installed, check if it needs updating to a newer stable version:
    ```
    brew update
    brew upgrade nodejs
    ```

4. Install Yarn globally and verify a successful install by checking its version output:
    ```
    sudo npm install -g yarn
    yarn --version
    ```

### Clone repository and build application

1. Navigate to an appropriate place on your disk and clone the Polkadot Live application repository.
    ```
    cd ~
    mkdir Polkadot && cd Polkadot
    gh repo clone polkadot-live/polkadot-live-app
    ```

2. Enter the project root directory.
    ```
    cd polkdadot-live-app
    ```

3. Set yarn to version 4:
    ```
    yarn set version berry
    ```

4. Install project dependencies
    ```
    yarn install
    ```

5. Build and package the application.
    ```
    yarn package
    ```

6. The application will be built in the `out/` directory. Now we need to codesign the application so macOS doesn't prevent us from opening it.
    
	You may need to install Xcode developer tools to access the `codesign` utility:
	```
    xcode-select --install
    ```

    Codesign the built application:
	```
	cd out/Polkadot\ Live-darwin-arm64/
	codesign --force --deep --sign - Polkadot\ Live.app
	```

7. Launch Polkadot Live by opening Finder and double clicking the application icon:
    ```
    open .
    ```
