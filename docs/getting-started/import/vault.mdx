### 4. Scan an account's QR code from the Polkadot Vault application.

An overlay will render showing your system's camera output. From here, open an address QR code within the Polkadot Vault application, and hold the QR code infront of the camera. Polkadot Live will detect and read the QR code caught on camera, and add a corresponding account entry to the Accounts window.

### 5. Wait for the account to import.

A 3-dot animation will be rendered over the `Add/Remove` button while the account is being imported. During this import process, the account's data will be fetched from its corresponding blockchain network. Such data will include its balance and staking status.

After the import process completes, a native OS notification will be shown to notify you of a successful import. The account will also be listed under the main windows `Subscriptions` tab. This means that you can now manage the account's subscriptions in the main window.

### 6. Rename the imported account.

By default, an imported account's name will be a truncated version of its encoded blockchain address. It is recommended to name an imported account to make it easily identifiable within the application. To rename an account, simply click its name (the text above its address) and type in a new one. Press the `Enter` key after you've typed in a name to save it.
