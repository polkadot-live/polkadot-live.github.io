### 1. Sorting controls

Use the sorting controls to customize how events are listed. The sorting controls row comprises the following buttons (documented from left to right):

- __Newest First__<br />
  Render events in descending (newest first) or ascending (oldest first) order. An event's timestamp is used to determine the sorting order.

- __Grouping__<br />
  When turned on, events are grouped by their category. When this button is off, events are rendered as a single list and un-categorized.

### 2. Events group

Event items are grouped by their respective subscription category. Click on a group header to expand and collapse it, respectively.

### 3. Event item

An event item is comprised of the following information:

- __Title__: Normally an account or network name.
- __Subtitle__: Normally the corresponding subscription name.
- __Notification Text__: The actual notification text.

Event items are dynamically rendered where some have more features than others, such as __actions__ and __links__. Consult the documentation below to understand these features below.

## Event Items

### Overview

An event item may have dynamic buttons which are referred to as __actions__ and __links__:

- __Actions__: Allow you to submit an extrinsic in response to an event item.
- __Links__: Allow you to open a webpage in a browser window to inspect the result of an event in more detail.

:::note

As an example, consider an __Unclaimed Nomination Pool Rewards__ event item:
- Action buttons to __Compound__ or __Withdraw__ the rewards are present on the event item, providing it's associated account is not a read-only account. Clicking either one of these buttons will open the __Actions__ window, allowing you to sign and submit the extrinsic to its respective blockchain network.
- A link button is included that opens the __Staking Dashboard__ website in a browser window. You are subsequently able to inspect your nomination pool setup in more detail via the Staking Dashboard website.

### Examples

An event item with both actions and links associated with it:

<Img url="/img/ui/ui-event-item-01.png" maxHeight="165px" />

<Img url="/img/ui/ui-event-item-02.png" maxHeight="165px" />

Event items with only links associated with it. Note that `Alice Account` is a read-only account, which means that action buttons will not be rendered on the event, in this case to compound or withdraw nomination pool rewards:
