# Main Window

The Polkadot Live main window can be viewed as the application's center-point where the majority of processing takes place - such as instantiating and connecting to APIs,  processing subscriptions, as well as communicating with other windows and processes.

The main window allows regular Polkadot Live users to accomplish a range of tasks, including:
- Viewing event items generated from subscription callbacks.
- Enabling subscriptions and managing their settings.
- Opening other Polkadot Live windows.
- Managing network RPC endpoints via the footer component.
