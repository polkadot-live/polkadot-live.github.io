# OpenGov Subscriptions UI

## Overview

Amoung Polkad Live's subscription types, OpenGov subscriptions expose the most customization options. This is because their underlying architecture relies on an interval that executes "ticks" in a background process. As a result, you can control how often to trigger OpenGov subscriptions. All exposed settings for this subscription type are detailed below.

## User Interface

<Img url="/img/ui/ui-main-subscription-opengov.png" maxHeight="120px" />

### 1. Help Icon

<HelpIconPartial />

### 2. Subscription Title

<SubscriptionTitlePartial />

### 3. Remove Subscription

Click this button twice to remove the subscription. Upon clicking this button for the first time, a five second timer is started. If you don't provide a second click within this time period, the button will reset.

In order to re-subscribe an OpenGov subscription, you will need to open the __OpenGov Window__ and click the referendum's appropriate subscribe button.

### 4. Preview Subscription

<PreviewButtonPartial />

### 5. Set Interval

Click this button to set a trigger interval. In other words, this setting controls how often you will trigger the subscription to receive an up-to-date event item and (optionally) a native OS notification.

The smallest time interval you can select is currently 15 minutes, while the biggest is 24 hours.

:::info

If you close Polkadot Live, its internal interval ticker will stop and will be resumed when you re-open the application. With this in mind, it is necessary to keep Polkadot Live open in order to receive OpenGov notifications in exact intervals according to the subscription setting.

Click the __Preview Subscription__ button at any time to render an up-to-date event item and (optional) native OS notification.

### 6. OS Notifications
