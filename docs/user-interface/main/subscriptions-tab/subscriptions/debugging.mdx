# Debugging Subscriptions UI

## Overview

Debugging subscriptions are displayed in Polkadot Live if the [Show Debugging Subscriptions](../../../../app-settings/subscriptions) setting is enabled within the settings window. The goal of enabling a debugging subscription is to confirm that your system is able to connect to a blockchain network, subscribe to its latest blocks, and display appropriate event items.

Refer to the [Debugging Subscriptions](../../../../subscriptions/debugging) documentation to discover which debugging subscriptions are provided.

## User Interface

Debugging subscriptions can only be toggled on or off. When turned on, an event item is rendered under the main window's **Events** tab when a new block is received from the subscription's respective blockchain network. Note that native OS notifications are not enabled for debugging subscriptions.
