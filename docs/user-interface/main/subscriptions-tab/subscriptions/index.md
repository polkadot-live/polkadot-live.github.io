# Subscriptions UI Overview

There are currently three subscription types in Polkadot Live:

- Account subscriptions
- OpenGov subscriptions
- Debugging subscriptions

Since each subscription type has a unique architecture, a different UI is exposed for each. This section of the documentation details the UI for each subscription type, and explains how to customize the behavior of individual subscriptions.
