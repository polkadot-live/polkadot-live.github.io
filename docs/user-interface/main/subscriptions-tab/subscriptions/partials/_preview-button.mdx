Click this button to preview the subscription. Two things will happen when clicking this button:

- A new event item is rendered under the main windows **Events Tab**. 
- A native OS notification is displayed. 

Every subscription in Polkadot Live will generate a unique event item and native OS notification with appropriate data and text. Keep in mind that you will receive a OS notification even if you have silenced OS notifications via the settings window.
