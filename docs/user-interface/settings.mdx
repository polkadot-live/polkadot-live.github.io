# Settings Window

## Overview

The settings window is opened by clicking the `Settings` item in the main window's cog menu. Use this window to configure Polkadot Live to your preferences. Please refer to the [Application Settings](/category/application-settings) documentation to learn about what each setting accomplishes.

Your chosen settings are persisted between Polkadot Live launches, meaning your preferred settings are remembered until the next time you make a change.

### 1. Settings category

Settings are categorized into panels which can be collapsed and expanded, simply by clicking the panel header. Note that only one settings category will be displayed at a time in order to keep UX optimal.

### 2. Setting title and help icon

The left hand side of a setting item includes its title and help icon. The title provides a shorthand description of what the setting achieves. Click on the `i` icon to the left of the title to open a help overlay, which explains the setting in more detail.

### 3. Setting toggle

The right hand side of a setting item will render a toggle or a button, depending on what the setting requires. Simply click on a toggle to turn a setting on or off. The application immediately reflects the state of a toggle, allowing you to see its effects first-hand.

For example, clicking the `Docked Window` toggle to "on" will immediately resize the main window and move it below the Polkadot Live application icon. Polkadot Live windows also communicate via port channels, meaning a window's UI can update in response to an event in another window. In this example, the `docked` button in the main window's header will update it's text and icon when the `Docked Window` setting is toggled via the settings window.
