### 1. Sorting controls

Use the sorting controls to customize how the fetched ongoing referenda are listed. The sorting controls row comprises the following buttons (documented from left to right):

- __Back__<br />
  Go back to the OpenGov window home screen.

- __Newest First__<br />
  Render referenda in descending (newest first) or ascending (oldest first) order. Referenda IDs are compared to determine the sorting order.

- __Grouping__<br />
  When turned on, referenda are categorized by origin in a collapsible panel. When this button is off, referenda will be rendered as a single list and un-categorized.

- __Expanded__<br />
  This button is enabled when grouping is turned on. It will expand or collapse all category panels.

- __Refresh Referenda__<br />
  Re-fetches ongoing referenda from the selected blockchain network. The UI will transition into a loading state while up-to-date referenda information is being fetched.

- __Show Subscribed__<br />
  Will only list referenda that have active subscriptions.

### 2. Sticky headings

Table column titles are rendered as sticky headings, meaning the headings will "stick" to the top of the window as it is being scrolled. Sticky headings are only displayed when the `Grouping` button is turned off.

### 3. Referenda rows

A referenda row includes the following items (from left to right):

- __Referenda ID__<br />
  The actual ID of the referendum that is stored on the blockchain.

- __Title and Origin__<br />
  The referendum's title metadata along with its associated origin. Note that the title and `More` button will not be shown when the Polkassembly is disabled via the settings window.

- __Portal Links__<br />
  Buttons are provided to instantly navigate to either the Polkassembly or Subsquare OpenGov portal websites within a web browser, and subsequently view the referendum in question along with community discussions.

- __Subscribe Buttons__<br />
  The `+` button will instantly subscribe to all metrics available for the referendum. When subscription(s) have been enabled for a referendum, a new entry is added to the main window's `Subscriptions` tab where you are able to adjust the subscription settings and behavior. 
  
  The second button will open a panel that lists individual subscriptions available for the referendum. Simply click `Subcscribe` or `Unsubscribe` to manage your subscriptions.
