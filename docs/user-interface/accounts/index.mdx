# Accounts Window

## Overview

Polkadot Live currently supports importing __Polkadot__, __Kusama__ and __Westend__ encoded addresses. There are three methods for importing addresses, which are:

- Scanning a QR code via the Vault application.
- Reading a Polkadot addresss from a Ledger Hardware wallet connected via USB.
- Typing (or pasting) an address for read-only accounts.

The __Accounts__ window is used to accomplish the following tasks:

- Import and manage accounts via the Vault application.
- Import and manage a ledger hardware wallet Polkadot address.
- Import and manage read-only addresses.

Each address import method is handled in its own screen. The following global operations can be performed on an address after importing it, regardless of its import method:

- Add the account to the main window.
- Remove the account from the main window.
- Delete the account from Polkadot Live.

## Window Communication

An account is automatically sent to the Polkadot Live main window from the accounts window after it is imported. As a result, the account is rendered under the __Subscriptions__ tab in the main window. Clicking the account entry will display its available subscriptions.

Accounts must be "added" to the main window in order for Polkadot live to expose subscriptions for that account. Conversely, accounts can be removed from the main window by clicking the corresponding `Remove` button within the **Accounts** window. 

Removing an account will unsubscribe it from any active subscriptions, and remove its entry from the main window. However, it will still exist in the __Accounts__ window and can be re-added at any time.

This design decision proves beneificial in the situation where a user has imported many accounts, but only wishes to enable subscriptions for some of those accounts. Instead of having to deal with a huge accounts list in the main window, a subset of accounts may be added via the __Accounts__ window.

:::info

When an address is imported, it is wrapped within a data structure called `Account`. However, the terms "address" and "account" can be used interchangeably within Polkadot Live.
