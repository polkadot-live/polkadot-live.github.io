Each imported address is represented by an account row containing the following items from left to right:

- __Polkicon__<br />
  A uniquely colored polkadot-themed icon where colours are derived from the address itself.

- __Address Input Field__<br />
  Displays the account name and its associated address below. By default, the account name will be a truncated version of its address. Simple click on the account name, type a new name followed by pressing the **Enter** key to update it.

  After renaming an account, Polkadot Live will automatically update event items and associated account data in the main window to reflect the new name. You can rename an account that has active subscriptions and associated event items without worrying about account names becoming out of sync.

  :::

- __Add / Remove and Delete Buttons__<br />
  - `Add`: The account data is sent to the main window and a new entry is added under the __Subscriptions__ tab.
  - `Remove`: The account is removed from the main window's __Subscriptions__ tab and any active subscriptions associated with the account are turned off.
  - `Delete`: completely remove the account from Polkadot Live. You will need to re-import the account in order for Polkadot Live to use it for subscriptions.
