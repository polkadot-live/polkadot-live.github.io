<Img url="/img/app-settings/general.png" />

## Docked Window

This setting controls whether the main window is free floating and resizable, or in a fixed size and position on the screen.

### Turned On

The main window is docked under the Polkadot Live application icon with a fixed size. You are unable to freely drag or resize the main window.

### Turned Off

The main window is free floating and resizable in the vertical direction. You are free to drag the window to an arbitrary location on the screen. You are also able to resize the main window in the vertical direction by clicking and dragging the horizontal window borders.

## Enable Polkassembly Data

This setting enables the Polkassembly API, which is used to fetch OpenGov proposal metadata that is subsequently rendered in the OpenGov window. It is recommended to enable this setting if you wish to browse and subscribe to OpenGov referenda. Turning this setting off will speed up the rendering of OpenGov referenda listings, but the listings will not include important proposal metadata.

### Turned On

The OpenGov window's referenda listings will display readable proposal titles and descriptions, the same of which can be seen on OpenGov portals including Polkassembly and Subsquare. You are able to quickly read proposal metadata directly within Polkadot Live, without having to navigate to an external OpenGov portal website.

### Turned Off

When this setting is disabled, the Polkassembly API will not be used to fetch proposal metadata. As a result, the OpenGov window's referenda listings will only render "decentralized" data - information fetched from the respective blockchain network - including the proposal ID and its respective track. You will need to click on an portal link to view a proposal's metadata on an external OpenGov website.
