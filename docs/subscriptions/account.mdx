# Account Subscriptions

## Balances

### Transfers

Get notified when any part of an account's balance changes.

A Polkadot balance is comprised of a **free**, **reserved**, and **frozen** balance. Regular transfers to and from other addresses will change your free balance, whilst staking and voting activities may change your reserved and frozen balances, respectively.

## Nomination Pools

<Img url="/img/subscriptions/nomination-pools.png" maxHeight="395px" />

### Commission Change

Get notified when your nomination pool's commission setting has changed.

A larger commission percentage may indicate that you will receive less rewards, as the nomination pool will take a bigger cut of rewards at the end of each era.

### Pool Name Changed

Get notified when your nomination pool's name has changed upon a new era starting.

### Pool State Changed

Get notified when your nomination pool has changed its state setting upon a new era starting.

The **"Open"** state means that anyone can join the pool and no members can be permissionlessly removed.

The **"Blocked"** state means that no members can join the pool, and some admin roles can permissionlessly kick (unbond) members.

The **"Destroying"** state means that no members can join the pool, and all members can be permissionlessly removed

### Roles Changed

Get notified when your nomination pool has changed its roles setting upon a new era starting.

### Unclaimed Rewards

Get notified when you have unclaimed nomination pool rewards upon a new era starting.


## Nominating

### Commission Changed

Get notified when any of your nominated validators have changed their commission setting upon a new era starting.

You will be notified when you have nominated new validators in the new era, and when any validators that you nominated in the previous era have changed their commision setting.

### Exposure Changed

Get notified when your nominating exposure changes when a new era starts.

Your address is "exposed" in the current era when at least one of your nominated validators are selected to actively participate in consensus, and thus may have a chance of receiving rewards.

### Pending Payouts

Get notified when you have pending payouts from your nomiated validators.

Polkadot Live will process the last 7 eras in order to calculate any pending payouts. This calculation may take a minute, depending on your network connection speed.
